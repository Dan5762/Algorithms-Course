# Algorithms-Course

This repository contains code written while taking the algorithms specialization on Coursera, produced Stanford University and given by Tim Roughgarden. The course can be found at:

    https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms

The code is written entirely by myself and is written to solve the exercises at the end of each week of the course.
