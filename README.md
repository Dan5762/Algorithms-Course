# Algorithms-Course

This repository contains code written while taking the [algorithms specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) on Coursera, produced Stanford University and given by Tim Roughgarden. The code was written entirely by myself in order to solve the exercises at the end of each week of the course.
